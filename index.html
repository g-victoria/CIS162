    <h2>About me</h2>

<p>
My name is Gabriel Victoria, and I'm relatively new to the Information Technology industry. My previous experience is in the financial sector, specifically within the insurance and real estate industries. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity and have only a few courses left to complete my A.S. program.
Recently, an opportunity arose at my part-time job to assist the application development team. By learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'll be able to contribute more effectively to our current projects, benefiting both myself and the organization.
I also have an entrepreneurial spirit and hope to start my own side business in the Information Technology field in the near future.
</p>

<h2>When I have free time</h2>

<ol>
    <li>I enjoy learning new things, especially about Information Technology.</li>
    <li>I love spending time with family.</li>
    <li>I enjoy exploring locally and discovering new food spots.</li>
</ol>

<p>
My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> because you can find so much interesting content.
