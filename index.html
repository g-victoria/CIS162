        <h2>Hello...</h2>
        <p>My name is Gabriel Victoria, and I'm relatively new to the Information Technology industry. My previous experience is in the financial sector, specifically within the insurance and real estate industries. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity and have only a few courses left to complete my A.S. program.
        Recently, an opportunity arose at my part-time job to assist the application development team. By learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'll be able to contribute more effectively to our current projects, benefiting both myself and the organization.
        I also have an entrepreneurial spirit and hope to start my own side business in the Information Technology field in the near future.</p>
